Nunavut is the newest territory of the Dominion of Canada. It is the easternmost territory and contains the northernmost point in Canada. Its capital is Iqaluit. Nunavut shares land borders with the Canadian provinces and territories of the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador, and with the territory of Greenland. Nunavut was first settled about 4500 years ago by the Pre-Dorset people who crossed the Bering Strait from Asia. Now, Nunavut has a permanent population of almost 40,000, of whom more than 22,000 speak Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit, natively, making it the only province or territory of Canada whose majority language is neither English nor French. 85% of these 40,000 are Inuit, and 1% are other Indigenous populations; only 12% are of European descent. The land of Nunavut is mostly frozen tundra, which explains why there are only 40,000 people living in a territory the size of Mexico, which has 132 million people. High temperatures in Iqaluit are usually in the 50s Fahrenheit in the summer and subzero in the winter. The territory is home to 200 species of flowers, almost 300 species of birds, and 57 species of mammals. Mining for iron and gold, drilling for oil, and tourism are the major industries in Nunavut; the government is also a major employer. Nunavut is the second largest legislative district in the world by area after Greenland, electing just one member of Parliament to the Canadian House of Commons for the entire territory. Its territorial government is the unicameral Legislative Assembly, which is consensus-based, meaning political parties are virtually non-existent and have no bearing on the legislature nor the cabinet. The head of this government is known as the Premier of Nunavut. Due to prohibition laws influenced by local and traditional beliefs, Nunavut has a highly regulated alcohol market. The territory is the last outpost of prohibition in Canada, and it is often easier to obtain firearms than alcohol.
